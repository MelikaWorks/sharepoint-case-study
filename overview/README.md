## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to design and implement an integrated platform for:

- Secretariat / Mailroom workflow automation
- Project lifecycle management via Project Server (PWA)
- Approval flows across multiple organizational roles
- Centralized reporting and progress tracking

The solution combined SharePoint lists and libraries, Project Server entities,
and Nintex workflows to achieve a unified enterprise process.

### Project Status
The system was implemented and tested in a real environment.
After a SharePoint Server upgrade, Nintex components became incompatible,
resulting in loss of designer access and export capabilities.
The project was therefore frozen and documented in its current state.
