# Employee Satisfaction Survey (SharePoint Case Study)

This folder documents the design and implementation of an employee
satisfaction survey developed using SharePoint Server.

The survey was deployed across multiple factories to collect structured
feedback on workplace conditions, safety, and organizational environment.

All responses were collected anonymously. No personal identifiers such as
employee name or personnel number were stored or exposed.

## Survey Overview

The survey was designed as a SharePoint Survey List with a customized form
layout and structured question sets.

Key characteristics:
