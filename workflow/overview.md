# Workflow Overview

This folder documents the design and implementation of the
Secretariat and Mailroom workflow developed using
SharePoint Server and Nintex Workflow.

The workflow was implemented across multiple factories to
standardize correspondence handling, approval routing,
notifications, and archiving.

Due to platform upgrades and localization limitations,
the workflow was paused at production level.
This repository preserves the process design,
approval logic, and implementation approach as a case study.
