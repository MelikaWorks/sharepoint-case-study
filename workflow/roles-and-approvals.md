# Roles and Approval Structure

The workflow was designed using a role-based approval model.

## Defined Roles

- Final Approver

## Approval Logic
- Sequential approvals based on document type
- Conditional branching for rework or rejection
- Escalation paths for delayed responses

## Access Control
- Role-based visibility of tasks
- Edit permissions limited to responsible roles
- Read-only access for audit purposes
