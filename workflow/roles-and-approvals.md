# Roles and Approval Structure

The workflow follows a role-based approval model to ensure
clear responsibility, controlled access, and traceable decisions.

## Defined Roles

- **Secretariat Operator**
  - Registers incoming and outgoing correspondence
  - Initiates the workflow

- **Department Reviewer**
  - Reviews assigned documents
  - Provides feedback or recommendations

- **Department Manager**
  - Makes approval or rejection decisions
  - Can re-route items when necessary

- **Final Approver**
  - Issues final confirmation
  - Closes the workflow process

## Approval Logic

- Sequential approvals based on correspondence type
- Conditional branching for rejection or rework
- Escalation paths for delayed or unattended items

## Access Control

- Tasks are visible only to assigned roles
- Edit permissions are limited to responsible users
- Read-only access is maintained for audit and reporting
